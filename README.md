# CitrusHack2016

PROJECT TITLE: Trivia Game

Trivia Game is a studying game coded by Adrian Tran and Braeton Buckley for
UCR's annual hackathon, CitrusHack, in 2016. The Hackathon's duration was 36 hours.

The project was coded using Amazon's Web Services. The language used was
Javascript. We extracted some base code from Amazon's website.

We were very ambitious in this project. We decided to split up our resources
to code two different functionalities. Braeton wanted to program an information
extractor that tells the user about a certain League of Legends player's
current ranking. I wanted to program a trivia game, useful for studying.

Ultimately, we decided to pool our resources on just the trivia game.
Braeton's unfinished code is in the opgg file; everything else is mine.

One thing that we struggled with in particular was getting used to coding in
Javascript. Prior to this Hackathon, both of us had no experience coding
in Javascript. It was a challenge reading the code and trying to understand
it at first. However, we managed to complete the project, and placed second
in our category (programs using the Alexa).

The Hackathon and completion of this project took place on November 2016.
